# What is SQL and SQL Server
SQL: stands for Structured Query Language, which is a structured query language, allows you to access and manipulate databases. SQL is standard language for relational database system, All database management systems (RDBMS): MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres or SQL Server adopt SQL as the standard database language.

Some of SQL Benefits are:
