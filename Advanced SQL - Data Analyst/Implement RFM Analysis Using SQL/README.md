# RFM Analysis with SQL
RFM Analysis is a way to use data based on existing customer behaviour to predict how a new customer is likely to act in the future. An RFM model is built using 3 key factors:
- How recently a customer has transacted with a brand.
- How frequently they have engaged with a brand
- How much money they have spent on a brand’s products and services.


## History of RFM Analysis:
RFM analysis was born out of direct mail marketing, in a particular 1995 article by Tom Wansbeek and Jan Roelf Built titled ‘Optimal Selection for Direct Mail’, which was published in the journal Marketing Science. Their work helped confirm the Pareto Principle – the idea widely held among marketers that 80% of sales come from 20% of a brand’s customers.
