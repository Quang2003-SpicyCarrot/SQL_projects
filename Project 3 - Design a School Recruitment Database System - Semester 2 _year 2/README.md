These are exercises included in the essential reading book.

# Question 2 - Database Modelling
In this part, you are asked to design a database to support a Instant Recruitment System of casual staff for a
school. The major business requirements are summarised below in the Mini Case: An Instant Recruitment System.
You are asked to develop a detailed Entity-Relationship model for this mini case. Your ER model should consist of a 
detailed ER diagram integrated with itemised discussions on the features of the entities and relationships and all the assumptions you made where applicable. The ER diagram and the accompanying document should identify keys,
constraints, entity types, relationship types, specialisation/generalisation if any, etc. You must use the same notation scheme for the ER diagram as the textbook (use UML notations as shown in the last page of the textbook, and don't use Crew Foot notations), and the ER diagram should be strictly in the way the textbook uses for.  

For this assignment, you may consider making use of the drawing tool https://draw.io, or simply Microsoft
PowerPoint. We note that our past experiences show drawing ER diagrams or relation diagrams on Microsoft
Powerpoint gives one better control and flexibility when compared with drawing diagrams with Microsoft Word.  
1. The ER diagram should include, among others, representative attributes for all entity types, proper subclassing
if any, and correct participation multiplicities for the relationship types. It should be meaningfully and well
designed, and should also include all relevant and necessary aspects, and indicate any supplementary business
rules if you decide to introduce. In any case, supply at least 1 concise business rule that you feel quite
important to your resulting database design. (3 marks)
2. Map the above ER diagram into a global relation diagram (GRD). The GRD should be in a form similar to
Figure 17.9 (page 554, or 516 for edition 5) of the textbook, but all the attributes should be kept there too.
Include in the diagram all the primary keys, foreign keys, and the multiplicity constraints. (2 marks)
3. Please note that an ERD is the artefact of the conceptual database design phase, while a GRD is the artfact of
the logical database design phase which relates to the relational models. As such, a good ERD should be
conceptually more concise and the relationships there should in general remain so rather than becoming extra
entities as in a relational model
